# 👋 Hi, I'm Pavel

Backend & Automation Developer (Node.js · real-time systems · trading bots · Web3)

I build high-load, real-time and automation systems that solve real product problems.  
I enjoy simplifying complex logic, removing manual work and making systems reliable at scale.

## 🔒 About my work
Most of my professional work is under NDA, as the products are security-focused and built entirely on in-house frameworks. 
This GitHub includes small side projects and experiments for learning and keeping up with modern tech.

## 💻 What I’ve built
- DEX trading bot ($500M+ volume, 32 instances, full-cycle)
- CEX arbitrage bot (5–8ms execution via TLS, borrowing, order chains)
- Headless automation clients (Puppeteer/WebSocket, event-driven)
- Multichain desktop app (Electron + Vue, blockchain REST APIs)
- Contributed to a microservice-based automation platform with remote device control and real-time data replication

## 🛠 Tech Stack
`Node.js`, `JavaScript`, `TypeScript`, `Vue.js`, `Web3`, `MongoDB`, `REST`, `WebSocket`, `Git`, `Linux`, `SQLite`
`PostgreSQL`, `Nest.js`, `ClickHouse`, `Docker`, `Nginx`, `Redis`, `BullMQ`, `OpenAI API`, `Telegraf`

## 🧠 How I work and think
- Focus on results, not hours
- Explain complex things in a simple way
- Understand business goals, not just code
- Love working in a team, can own critical modules
- Take responsibility and deliver
