# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Pavel

Backend & Automation Developer (Node.js Â· real-time systems Â· trading bots Â· Web3)

I build high-load, real-time and automation systems that solve real product problems.  
I enjoy simplifying complex logic, removing manual work and making systems reliable at scale.

## ðŸ”’ About my work
Most of my professional work is under NDA, as the products are security-focused and built entirely on in-house frameworks. 
This GitHub includes small side projects and experiments for learning and keeping up with modern tech.

## ðŸ’» What Iâ€™ve built
- DEX trading bot ($500M+ volume, 32 instances, full-cycle)
- CEX arbitrage bot (5â€“8ms execution via TLS, borrowing, order chains)
- Headless automation clients (Puppeteer/WebSocket, event-driven)
- Multichain desktop app (Electron + Vue, blockchain REST APIs)
- Contributed to a microservice-based automation platform with remote device control and real-time data replication

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
**Core:** Node.js, JavaScript, MongoDB, REST, WebSocket, Vue.js, Web3, Git, SQLite, Linux  
**Also used:** TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Docker, Nginx, Nest.js, Redis, BullMQ, OpenAI API, Telegraf

## ðŸ§  How I work and think
- Focus on results, not hours
- Explain complex things in a simple way
- Understand business goals, not just code
- Love working in a team, can own critical modules
- Take responsibility and deliver
